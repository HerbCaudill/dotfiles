description: >
  Forces programmatic shortcuts (API interception, JS scraping, bulk fetch) instead of manual clicking for ANY repetitive browser or web app task. MUST trigger before clicking through lists, extracting data from multiple pages, or repeating actions across items in any web app (CRMs, dashboards, admin panels, email). Trigger on: "go through", "process these", "pull data from", "extract", "scrape", "bulk", "batch", "automate", "speed up". If about to click a second item in a list, STOP and use this skill.

# Browser & App Optimizer

You are about to do work in a browser or app. **STOP. Do not click through items one by one.**
The single most important rule: **every repetitive browser task has a programmatic shortcut that is 5-50x faster than clicking.** Your job is to find it and use it. Manual clicking is the last resort, not the first instinct.

## Technique Quick Reference`

Before diving into recon, here's the full menu of extraction techniques ranked by speed. Pick the highest one available:
| Level | Technique | Speed | When to use |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | **Dedicated MCP/CLI** | Instant | App has an MCP connector (Airtable, Slack, Gmail, etc.) |
| 1 | **Export button (CSV/XLSX)** | Seconds | App has export feature — one click gets everything |
| 2 | **Window globals** | Seconds | Framework dumps data into `__NEXT_DATA__`, `__REDUX_STATE__`, etc. |
| 3 | **Hidden API** | Minutes | Reproduce the app's own `fetch()` calls with `{credentials: 'include'}` |
| 4 | **DOM scraping** | Minutes | Data visible in page — `querySelectorAll` on rows/cards/tables |
| 5 | **localStorage/IndexedDB** | Minutes | App caches datasets client-side |
| 6 | **URL pattern exploitation** | Minutes | Predictable URL structure → parallel `fetch()` by ID |
| 7 | **Keyboard shortcuts** | Varies | Action-heavy tasks — bulk tag, archive, advance |
| 8 | **Programmatic form filling** | Varies | Bulk input/data entry with React-compatible value setting |

**For writing back** (bulk updates, status changes, tagging): discover mutation endpoints alongside reads — see Write-Back section.
**For getting data out of the browser** (PII filter workarounds): file download, clipboard, DOM overlay, console, or window variables — see Output Limitations section.

## Phase 0: Size Check → Then Recon

**Before anything else, estimate the dataset size.** Take one screenshot or glance at the UI.

- **<20 items total** (no pagination, no "showing X of Y"): **Skip recon. Just click through them.** Direct clicking at 5-10 seconds per item = under 3 minutes. Recon would take longer.
- **20-50 items**: Quick recon only — do Step 1 (MCP check, 10 sec). If no MCP, quick network tab scan (30 sec). If you spot an API, use it. If not, click through.
- **50+ items**, or you see pagination / "Load more" / infinite scroll: **Always do full recon.** Spend up to 2 minutes. This is where the 10-100x speedup lives.
  The rule: **recon ROI scales with item count.** Don't spend 2 minutes optimizing a 10-item task.
  Once you've passed the size gate, run through the recon steps below. If you find an export button in Step 2, stop there — you're done in 15 seconds. The goal is to understand the app's architecture and pick the fastest attack vector before committing to an approach.
  **Step 1: Check for a dedicated MCP**
  Many apps already have a direct API connection sitting in your toolbox. Check before you do anything else — dedicated MCPs are pre-authenticated and faster than anything you could build in a browser.
  Common examples: databases, email, cloud storage, messaging, project management, version control CLIs. If the task involves one of these, skip the browser entirely. Use the MCP.
  If you're not sure what's available, check what MCP tools you have access to. If there's nothing for this specific app, proceed to Step 2.
  **Step 1.5: Start network monitoring BEFORE navigating**
  This is critical. The most important API calls happen on initial page load — the ones that fetch the full dataset. If you navigate first and start monitoring second, you miss them entirely and have to reverse-engineer what the browser already did for you.
  The sequence is always: `read_network_requests` → `navigate` → read the captured requests. If the page is already loaded, start monitoring and then **refresh the page** to capture the initial data-loading calls. This one sequencing change catches the data API for virtually every app on the first try.
  **Step 2: Check for export/bulk-download features**
  Before digging into APIs or DOM scraping, do a quick scan for export functionality. Almost every SaaS app has one, and it's almost always the single fastest path to getting all data at once — one click vs. pagination, scrolling, or API reverse-engineering.
  Run this JS to find export buttons:

```javascript
const exportElements = document.querySelectorAll(
  '[class*="export"], [class*="download"], [data-action*="export"], ' +
    'button[aria-label*="export" i], button[aria-label*="download" i], ' +
    'a[href*="export"], a[href*="download"], a[href*=".csv"], a[href*=".xlsx"], ' +
    "button:not([disabled])",
);
const matches = Array.from(exportElements).filter((el) =>
  el.textContent.match(/export|download|csv|xlsx|bulk/i),
);
JSON.stringify(
  matches.map((el) => ({
    tag: el.tagName,
    text: el.textContent.trim().substring(0, 50),
    href: el.href,
    ariaLabel: el.getAttribute("aria-label"),
  })),
);
```

Also try common export URL patterns directly:

- `/api/export?format=csv`
- `/api/v1/items.csv`
- `/download?type=xlsx`
- `/reports/export`
- Current URL + `?format=json` or `&output=csv`
  If an export button exists, **use it immediately** — skip the rest of recon. A CSV/XLSX export of 500 records takes 2 seconds. Reverse-engineering the API to get the same data takes 10 minutes.
  **Step 3: Detect scroll behavior**
  Before you commit to scrolling through a list, find out what kind of scrolling the app uses. This determines whether scroll-and-scrape is even viable:
  Run this JS to detect scroll type:

```javascript
const container =
  document.querySelector('[class*="scroll"], [class*="list"], [style*="overflow"]') ||
  document.scrollingElement;
const childCount1 = container?.children?.length || document.body.children.length;
const firstChildId =
  container?.children?.[0]?.dataset?.id || container?.children?.[0]?.textContent?.substring(0, 30);
// After detecting, scroll down and check again — if childCount stays the same
// but firstChildId changes, it's virtual scrolling (cards are being REPLACED, not appended)
JSON.stringify({
  initialChildCount: childCount1,
  firstChildPreview: firstChildId,
  scrollHeight: document.body.scrollHeight,
  instruction:
    "Scroll down, then run this again. Same count but different first child = VIRTUAL (cannot go back). Count grew = INFINITE APPEND (safe to scrape all). Neither changed = PAGINATED (check for page controls).",
});
```

Why this matters:

- **Virtual scrolling** (items replaced as you scroll): You CANNOT go back. Either find the API/export, or extract on first pass and accept you only get visible items.
- **Infinite append** (items added as you scroll): Scroll to bottom, then scrape everything — all items are in DOM.
- **Paginated** (explicit page controls): Use URL params to jump between pages, or find the API endpoint.
  **Step 4: Recon the app's architecture**
  Before clicking anything, do ALL of these:

1. **Network tab** — check `read_network_requests` for the API calls captured on page load (you started monitoring in Step 1.5). Look for JSON responses containing the dataset.
2. **Window globals** — run this JS immediately:
   Run this JS to check for framework globals:

```javascript
const globals = [
  "__NEXT_DATA__",
  "__NUXT__",
  "__INITIAL_STATE__",
  "__APP_STATE__",
  "__REDUX_STATE__",
  "__APOLLO_STATE__",
  "webpackJsonp",
  "__remixContext",
  "__PRELOADED_STATE__",
  "_sharedData",
  "__DATA__",
];
const found = globals.filter((g) => window[g]);
JSON.stringify({
  found_globals: found,
  next_data_keys: window.__NEXT_DATA__ ? Object.keys(window.__NEXT_DATA__) : null,
  redux_keys: window.__INITIAL_STATE__ ? Object.keys(window.__INITIAL_STATE__) : null,
  url: location.href,
  title: document.title,
});
```

If you find populated globals, the data is already client-side — no API calls needed. 3. **Local storage / IndexedDB** — run this JS to check for cached data:

```javascript
const lsKeys = Object.keys(localStorage);
const authKeys = lsKeys.filter((k) => k.match(/token|auth|session|jwt|api.key|credential/i));
const dataKeys = lsKeys.filter((k) => !k.match(/token|auth|session|jwt/i));
JSON.stringify({
  total_keys: lsKeys.length,
  auth_keys: authKeys,
  data_keys_sample: dataKeys.slice(0, 20),
  has_indexed_db: !!window.indexedDB,
});
```

4. **Page structure** — run this JS to scan the DOM:

```javascript
JSON.stringify({
  tables: document.querySelectorAll("table").length,
  rows: document.querySelectorAll('tr, [class*="row"], [class*="item"], [class*="card"]').length,
  links: document.querySelectorAll("a[href]").length,
  forms: document.querySelectorAll("form").length,
  iframes: document.querySelectorAll("iframe").length,
  dom_size: document.querySelectorAll("*").length,
  react_root: !!document.querySelector("[data-reactroot], #__next, #root"),
  vue_root: !!document.querySelector("[data-v-]"),
  angular_root: !!document.querySelector("[ng-app], [data-ng-app]"),
});
```

**Step 5: Plan for PII filter BEFORE extracting**
The Chrome MCP's `javascript_tool` blocks outputs containing email addresses, phone numbers, and other PII. If your task involves contacts, candidates, leads, users, or any people data, you WILL hit this filter. Plan your extraction method accordingly from the start — don't discover it mid-extraction and have to restart.
Quick decision: if you need emails/phones, go straight to **file download** (CSV blob → `a.click()`) or **clipboard** (`navigator.clipboard.writeText()`) as your extraction method. Don't waste time trying JS output first only to have it blocked. See the "Handling Output Limitations" section for the full workaround menu.
**Step 6: Estimate data volume and choose extraction strategy**
Before extracting, estimate the dataset size. This determines which extraction method is appropriate:

```
< 50 items  → Any method works. JS output with redacted PII is fine.
50-500 items → Export button or API pagination. DOM overlay + screenshot for PII data.
500+ items  → Export button or API with high limit param. Use file download, not screenshots.
1000+ items → Subagents for parallel processing after extraction.
```

A quick way to estimate: look at the item count in the UI (most apps show "Showing 1-25 of 263" or similar), or check the API response for `total`, `count`, or `meta.total` fields.
**Step 7: Choose your attack vector**
Based on recon, pick the fastest approach. The decision tree is:

```
Has dedicated MCP? → Use it (skip browser entirely)
  ↓ no
Has export/download button? → Click it (single action gets everything)
  ↓ no
Found window globals with data? → Extract directly from JS
  ↓ no
Spotted API calls in network tab? → Reproduce with fetch()
  ↓ no
Large DOM with data visible? → querySelectorAll scrape
  ↓ no
Data in localStorage/IndexedDB? → Read from storage
  ↓ no
URL patterns predictable? → Programmatic navigation
  ↓ none of these
Build a hybrid: JS recon + screenshot + OCR pipeline
  ↓ still failing
STOP. Don't spend >10 min cracking a heavily secured app.
Ask the user if they have export access or database credentials.
Fall back to computer_batch clicking if the item count is manageable.
```

## The Hierarchy of Speed

### Level 0: Dedicated MCP or CLI Tool (instant — already authenticated)

Before touching the browser, ask: does an MCP or CLI tool exist for this app?

- **Databases / spreadsheets** → Use their MCP to query/update directly
- **Email** → Use email MCP for search, read, draft
- **Cloud storage** → Use storage MCP for file operations
- **Version control** → Use CLI tools (faster than browser for issues, PRs, etc.)
- **Messaging** → Use messaging MCP for channels, search
- **Project management** → Check for dedicated MCPs
  These are 10-100x faster than browser automation because there's no rendering, no clicking, no screenshots. Pure data.

### Level 1: Export/Bulk Download (one click gets everything)

The most underused shortcut. Check for it early because it makes every other technique unnecessary.
Export buttons hide in predictable places: top-right nav bars, "..." overflow menus, settings/admin pages, right-click context menus on tables, and toolbar areas above data lists. The JS snippet in Phase 0 Step 2 finds them programmatically, but also just take a screenshot and look — sometimes a human eye spots "Export" faster than a DOM query.
After clicking export, the data lands as a CSV or XLSX file. Move processing to Python/Bash immediately — parse with pandas, filter, cross-reference, enrich. The browser's job is done.

### Level 2: Window Globals & Client-Side State (fastest in-browser technique)

Modern JS frameworks pre-load data into memory. You can read it directly.

```javascript
// Next.js apps dump EVERYTHING into __NEXT_DATA__
const nextData = window.__NEXT_DATA__;
if (nextData?.props?.pageProps) {
  JSON.stringify(Object.keys(nextData.props.pageProps));
  // Often contains the full dataset right here
}
// React apps with Redux
const state = window.__REDUX_STATE__ || window.__INITIAL_STATE__;
if (state) {
  JSON.stringify(Object.keys(state));
}
// Vue/Nuxt apps
const nuxtData = window.__NUXT__;
if (nuxtData?.data) {
  JSON.stringify(Object.keys(nuxtData.data));
}
```

**React fiber tree — the nuclear option for React apps:**

```javascript
// Access React's internal component tree to read state directly
function getReactFiber(el) {
  const key = Object.keys(el).find(
    (k) => k.startsWith("__reactFiber$") || k.startsWith("__reactInternalInstance$"),
  );
  return el[key];
}
const root = document.querySelector("#root, #__next, [data-reactroot]");
const fiber = getReactFiber(root);
// Walk the fiber tree to find the component with the data you need
// fiber.memoizedState contains hooks state
// fiber.memoizedProps contains props
```

### Level 3: Find the Hidden API (minutes instead of hours)

Almost every web app is a thin UI over a REST or GraphQL API. The data you want is one `fetch()` call away.
**Discovery method:**

1. Use `read_network_requests` (Chrome MCP) — captures all XHR/fetch traffic
2. Click through ONE item manually while watching
3. Spot the API pattern (URL structure, auth headers, response shape)
4. Reproduce with `fetch()` using `{credentials: 'include'}`
   **The canary request pattern** — run this JS to test with one call first:

```javascript
// Canary — understand the API before bulk-fetching
try {
  const canary = await fetch('/api/v1/items?limit=1', {credentials: 'include'});
  // Diagnose common failures immediately
  if (canary.status === 401 || canary.status === 403) {
    JSON.stringify({ error: 'Auth failed', status: canary.status,
      fix: 'Session expired or cookies not sent. Try: 1) Check if you need a Bearer token instead of cookies. 2) Look for auth tokens in localStorage. 3) The API might be on a different subdomain (CORS).' });
  }
  if (canary.status === 404) {
    JSON.stringify({ error: 'Endpoint not found', status: 404,
      fix: 'Wrong URL. Check network tab for the actual API path — it may differ from what you guessed.' });
  }
  if (!canary.ok) {
    JSON.stringify({ error: \`HTTP \${canary.status}\`, body: await canary.text().catch(() => 'unreadable') });
  }
  const sample = await canary.json();
  JSON.stringify({
    status: canary.status,
    headers: Object.fromEntries(canary.headers.entries()),
    response_keys: Object.keys(sample),
    total_count: sample.total || sample.count || sample.meta?.total,
    pagination: sample.next || sample.offset || sample.cursor,
    sample_item_keys: sample.data?.[0] ? Object.keys(sample.data[0]) : Object.keys(sample[0] || {})
  });
} catch (e) {
  JSON.stringify({ error: e.message,
    fix: e.message.includes('Failed to fetch') ? 'Likely a CORS issue — the API is on a different domain. Try running from the correct origin or find the request in the network tab to get the exact URL and headers.' : 'Unknown fetch error. Check the console for details.' });
}
```

```javascript
// Step 2: Now bulk-fetch everything (with rate limiting)
const ALL = [];
let skip = 0;
const LIMIT = 500; // Start high, server will cap if needed
while (true) {
  const resp = await fetch(\`/api/v1/items?skip=\${skip}&limit=\${LIMIT}\`, {credentials: 'include'});
  // Handle rate limiting — back off and retry
  if (resp.status === 429) {
    const retryAfter = resp.headers.get('Retry-After');
    const wait = retryAfter ? parseInt(retryAfter) * 1000 : 2000;
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, wait));
    continue; // Retry same page
  }
  if (!resp.ok) throw new Error(\`API returned \${resp.status}\`);
  const batch = await resp.json();
  const items = batch.data || batch.results || batch.items || batch;
  if (!items.length) break;
  ALL.push(...items);
  skip += items.length;
  if (items.length < LIMIT) break; // Last page
}
// ALL now contains everything
```

**Rate limiting awareness:** Many APIs will throttle you if you hit them too hard. Signs: 429 status codes, empty responses after N requests, or suddenly getting 403s. Mitigations:

- Start with sequential pagination (the loop above) — it's fast enough for most datasets
- For parallel fetches, batch in groups of 10-20 with `Promise.all()`, not 500 at once
- If you get 429s, respect `Retry-After` headers or back off exponentially (1s → 2s → 4s)
- Some APIs have undocumented rate limits — if you're getting inconsistent results, slow down
  **Common API patterns:**
- REST: `/api/v1/contacts?page=1&limit=100` — change `limit` to 1000
- GraphQL: single endpoint `/graphql` — introspect with `{__schema{queryType{fields{name}}}}`
- The API domain often differs from the app domain (e.g., `api.app.com` vs `app.app.com`)
- Pagination: `?skip=0&limit=50`, `?page=1`, `?cursor=abc`, `?after=xyz`
- Filters: `?status=active&filter=replied` — the UI filters are just query params
  **Auth patterns:**
- `{credentials: 'include'}` — sends session cookies, works 90% of the time
- Bearer tokens — check storage first, then intercept from network:

```javascript
// Method 1: Check localStorage/sessionStorage
const token = Object.keys(localStorage)
  .concat(Object.keys(sessionStorage))
  .filter((k) => k.match(/token|auth|session|jwt|bearer/i))
  .map((k) => ({ key: k, value: (localStorage[k] || sessionStorage[k]).substring(0, 50) + "..." }));
// Method 2: Intercept Authorization headers from live requests
const originalFetch = window.fetch;
window.__AUTH_HEADERS__ = [];
window.fetch = async function (...args) {
  const headers = args[1]?.headers;
  if (headers) {
    const authHeader =
      headers["Authorization"] ||
      headers["authorization"] ||
      (headers.get && headers.get("Authorization"));
    if (authHeader) window.__AUTH_HEADERS__.push(authHeader);
  }
  return originalFetch.apply(this, args);
};
// Click one thing in the app, then: window.__AUTH_HEADERS__[0]
// Use it: fetch(url, { headers: { 'Authorization': window.__AUTH_HEADERS__[0] } })
```

- API keys in headers — sniff from network requests
- CSRF tokens — look for `meta[name="csrf-token"]` or `X-CSRF-Token` headers
  **CORS gotchas:** If `fetch()` fails with "Failed to fetch" or a CORS error, the API is on a different domain than the page you're on. Solutions:
- Run your fetch from the **correct origin** — navigate to the API's domain first, or find a page on that domain
- Check the network tab for the exact request headers the app uses — some APIs require specific `Origin` or `Referer` headers
- If the app uses a proxy (e.g., `/api/` routes to `api.example.com`), your fetch from the same page will work — CORS only blocks cross-origin requests
- As a last resort, the data might be accessible from the page's own `fetch()` context since the browser already has the session — make sure you're running JS on the right tab
  **GraphQL deep dive** (for apps that use it):

```javascript
// Introspect the entire schema
const introspection = await fetch('/graphql', {
  method: 'POST',
  credentials: 'include',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: \`{ __schema { queryType { fields { name description args { name type { name } } } } } }\`
  })
});
const schema = await introspection.json();
JSON.stringify(schema.data.__schema.queryType.fields.map(f => f.name));
// Now you know every query available — pick the bulk data one
```

**GraphQL mutations — for writing back (bulk updates, status changes, tagging):**

```javascript
// Step 1: Discover available mutations
const mutations = await fetch('/graphql', {
  method: 'POST', credentials: 'include',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: \`{ __schema { mutationType { fields { name args { name type { name kind ofType { name } } } } } } }\`
  })
});
const mutationFields = (await mutations.json()).data.__schema.mutationType.fields;
JSON.stringify(mutationFields.map(f => ({ name: f.name, args: f.args.map(a => a.name) })));
```

```javascript
// Step 2: Bulk-execute mutations (e.g., update status on 50 items)
const ids = ['id1', 'id2', 'id3']; // your item IDs
const results = await Promise.all(ids.map(id =>
  fetch('/graphql', {
    method: 'POST', credentials: 'include',
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: \`mutation { updateItem(id: "\${id}", input: { status: "archived" }) { id status } }\`
    })
  }).then(r => r.json())
));
// All items updated in parallel
```

This is the missing half of most automation — reading data is only step one. The real power is bulk-updating records, changing statuses, tagging items, or advancing pipeline stages without clicking through each one.

### Level 4: DOM Scraping with JavaScript

If there's no clean API, the data is in the DOM.

```javascript
// Generic smart scraper — works on most list/table views
const rows = document.querySelectorAll(
  'tr[data-id], [class*="row"], [class*="item"], [class*="card"], [class*="entry"], [role="row"]',
);
const data = Array.from(rows).map((row) => {
  const cells = row.querySelectorAll('td, [class*="cell"], [class*="col"]');
  const links = row.querySelectorAll("a[href]");
  return {
    text: Array.from(cells).map((c) => c.textContent.trim()),
    id: row.dataset.id || row.getAttribute("data-key") || links[0]?.href,
    raw: row.textContent.trim().substring(0, 200),
  };
});
```

**Infinite scroll handling:**

```javascript
// Force-load all lazy content
async function loadAllContent() {
  let lastHeight = 0;
  while (true) {
    window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 500));
    if (document.body.scrollHeight === lastHeight) break;
    lastHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;
  }
  window.scrollTo(0, 0);
}
await loadAllContent();
// Now scrape the fully loaded DOM
```

**Shadow DOM piercing:**

```javascript
function deepQueryAll(selector, root = document) {
  const results = [...root.querySelectorAll(selector)];
  root.querySelectorAll("*").forEach((el) => {
    if (el.shadowRoot) results.push(...deepQueryAll(selector, el.shadowRoot));
  });
  return results;
}
```

### Level 5: Local Storage & IndexedDB Mining

Many apps cache entire datasets client-side. Free data, no network needed.

```javascript
// IndexedDB — access cached application data
const dbs = await indexedDB.databases();
const results = {};
for (const dbInfo of dbs) {
  const db = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const req = indexedDB.open(dbInfo.name);
    req.onsuccess = () => resolve(req.result);
    req.onerror = () => reject(req.error);
  });
  results[dbInfo.name] = {
    version: db.version,
    stores: Array.from(db.objectStoreNames),
  };
  db.close();
}
JSON.stringify(results);
```

### Level 6: URL Pattern Exploitation

Construct URLs directly instead of navigating.

```javascript
// Extract all item IDs from the list view, then fetch each detail page via API
const ids = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('[data-id], a[href*="/items/"]'))
  .map(el => el.dataset.id || el.href.match(/\/items\/([^/]+)/)?.[1])
  .filter(Boolean);
// Now fetch all detail pages in parallel (not sequentially!)
const details = await Promise.all(
  ids.map(id => fetch(\`/api/items/\${id}\`, {credentials: 'include'}).then(r => r.json()))
);
```

### Level 7: Keyboard Shortcut Chains

For action-heavy tasks where you need to DO things, not just read data.

```javascript
// Discover available shortcuts
const shortcuts = document.querySelectorAll("[accesskey], [data-shortcut], [data-hotkey]");
JSON.stringify(
  Array.from(shortcuts).map((el) => ({
    key: el.accessKey || el.dataset.shortcut || el.dataset.hotkey,
    text: el.textContent.trim(),
    action: el.getAttribute("aria-label") || el.title,
  })),
);
```

### Level 8: Programmatic Form Filling

For bulk input/action tasks:

```javascript
// React-compatible form filling
function setReactValue(input, value) {
  const setter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window.HTMLInputElement.prototype, "value").set;
  setter.call(input, value);
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event("input", { bubbles: true }));
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event("change", { bubbles: true }));
}
// For select elements
function setReactSelect(select, value) {
  const setter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window.HTMLSelectElement.prototype, "value").set;
  setter.call(select, value);
  select.dispatchEvent(new Event("change", { bubbles: true }));
}
// For contenteditable (rich text editors, etc.)
function setContentEditable(el, text) {
  el.focus();
  el.textContent = text;
  el.dispatchEvent(new InputEvent("input", { bubbles: true, data: text }));
}
```

---

## Write-Back: Mutation Discovery

Extraction is only half the job. Many tasks also require writing data back — bulk-updating statuses, tagging records, advancing pipeline stages, declining candidates, sending messages. The approach mirrors read discovery:

1. **After finding the read API, immediately check for write endpoints.** The same network tab that revealed `GET /api/candidates` will show `PATCH /api/candidates/:id` or `POST /api/candidates/:id/actions` when you click a button in the UI.
2. **For GraphQL apps**, introspect mutations alongside queries (see Level 3 above). Most GraphQL apps expose every write operation as a mutation — bulk status changes, tagging, archiving, sending.
3. **For REST apps**, the write patterns are predictable:
   - `PATCH /api/items/:id` — update a single record
   - `POST /api/items/bulk` — update multiple records at once
   - `DELETE /api/items/:id` — remove a record
   - `POST /api/items/:id/actions/archive` — trigger a specific action
4. **Always discover writes during recon, even if the current task is read-only.** You'll often need to write back later (e.g., extract candidates → filter → mark good ones as "shortlisted"). Having the write API mapped saves a second recon pass.
5. **Batch writes aggressively.** If the API accepts bulk operations, use them. If it doesn't, parallelize individual writes with `Promise.all()` in groups of 10-20 (respecting rate limits). Never update records one at a time with clicks.

## The Processing Pipeline (Extract → Transform → Load)

The browser is for extraction only. Once you have raw data, move processing to Python/Bash where you have full power.
**Pattern:**

1. **Extract** in browser (JS) — get the raw data as fast as possible
2. **Transfer** — get data out of the browser (export file, clipboard, overlay screenshot, or redacted JSON)
3. **Transform** in Python/Bash — filter, analyze, cross-reference, enrich
4. **Load** — write to spreadsheet, database, MCP, or back into the app
   This separation matters because:

- JS in the browser is constrained (output filtering, execution time limits)
- Python has unlimited libraries (pandas, openpyxl, regex, etc.)
- You can run complex analysis without the browser bottleneck
- Subagents can process different chunks in parallel
  **Standard post-extraction pipeline** (use this template for any data extraction task):

```
1. Data lands as CSV/JSON (from export, API, or DOM scrape)
2. Load into pandas: df = pd.read_csv('exported.csv')
3. Filter: df_good = df[df['criteria_score'] >= 3]
4. Cross-reference against existing DB (MCP query to check for dupes)
5. Batch-create/update records via MCP or API
6. Generate summary report
```

## This is the same pattern whether you're pulling candidates from a recruiting tool, leads from a CRM, tickets from a support tool, or contacts from a directory. Standardize on it.

## Parallel Execution with Subagents

For large datasets, split the work across multiple subagents running simultaneously.

```
Main agent: Extracts 500 contact IDs from the app
  → Subagent 1: Processes contacts 1-125
  → Subagent 2: Processes contacts 126-250
  → Subagent 3: Processes contacts 251-375
  → Subagent 4: Processes contacts 376-500
Main agent: Merges results
```

**When to split into subagents:**

- **100+ items needing enrichment** (web research, profile lookup, cross-referencing) — each subagent handles a chunk
- **Multiple independent data sources** — one subagent per source, merge results at the end
- **Large write-back operations** — split record updates across subagents to parallelize
  **When NOT to split:** if the task is pure extraction (one API call or one export click), subagents add overhead. Only split when there's per-item processing that would take minutes sequentially.

## Handling Output Limitations (Chrome MCP PII Filter)

The Chrome MCP's `javascript_tool` blocks outputs containing email addresses, phone numbers, and other PII. This is a known limitation. Pick your workaround using this decision tree:

```
Know you need PII (emails/phones) upfront?
  → Skip JS output entirely. Use File Download (#4) or Clipboard (#5) from the start.
Data is small (<50 rows) and no PII needed?
  → Try Redacted JSON first (#2) — strip emails/phones, return the rest as JSON
  → If blocked, use Console Output (#3)
Data is large (50+ rows)?
  → Use DOM Overlay + Screenshot (#1) — paginate 30-50 rows at a time
Need exact text (not OCR)?
  → Use File Download (#4) or Clipboard (#5) to get raw text out
Nothing else works?
  → Store in window variable (#6), read back in safe chunks
```

### 1. DOM Overlay Injection + Screenshot (most reliable for visual data)

```javascript
const overlay = document.createElement('div');
overlay.id = 'data-overlay';
overlay.style.cssText = 'position:fixed;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;background:white;z-index:999999;overflow:auto;padding:20px;font-family:monospace;font-size:11px;line-height:1.3;';
let html = '<table border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">';
html += '<tr style="background:#2E4057;color:white"><th>Name</th><th>Company</th><th>Details</th></tr>';
data.forEach((item, i) => {
  const bg = i % 2 ? '#f5f5f5' : 'white';
  html += \`<tr style="background:\${bg}"><td>\${item.name}</td><td>\${item.company}</td><td>\${item.details}</td></tr>\`;
});
html += '</table>';
if (data.length > 50) {
  html = \`<div style="margin-bottom:10px;font-weight:bold">Showing items 1-50 of \${data.length}. Page 1.</div>\` + html;
}
overlay.innerHTML = html;
document.body.appendChild(overlay);
```

### 2. Redacted JSON Output

```javascript
const safe = data.map((d, i) => ({
  index: i,
  name: d.name,
  company: d.company,
  signal: d.signal,
  date: d.date,
  // Email stripped — will recover via overlay
}));
JSON.stringify(safe);
```

### 3. Console Output + read_console_messages

```javascript
console.log('DATA_START');
data.forEach(d => console.log(\`\${d.name}|\${d.company}|\${d.status}\`));
console.log('DATA_END');
```

### 4. File Download Trigger

```javascript
const csv = data.map(d => \`"\${d.name}","\${d.company}","\${d.email}","\${d.status}"\`).join('\n');
const blob = new Blob(['Name,Company,Email,Status\n' + csv], {type: 'text/csv'});
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
const a = document.createElement('a');
a.href = url; a.download = 'extracted_data.csv'; a.click();
```

### 5. Clipboard Write

```javascript
const text = data.map(d => \`\${d.name}\t\${d.email}\t\${d.company}\`).join('\n');
await navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
```

### 6. Store in window variable, read back in chunks

```javascript
window.__EXTRACTED__ = data;
\`Stored \${data.length} items in window.__EXTRACTED__\`;
```

## Monkey-Patching for Request Interception

```javascript
const originalFetch = window.fetch;
window.__API_LOG__ = [];
window.fetch = async function (...args) {
  const url = typeof args[0] === "string" ? args[0] : args[0]?.url;
  const method = args[1]?.method || "GET";
  const response = await originalFetch.apply(this, args);
  window.__API_LOG__.push({ url, method, status: response.status, time: Date.now() });
  return response;
};
("Fetch patched. Navigate the app, then read window.__API_LOG__");
```

## WebSocket & Real-Time App Interception

```javascript
const originalWS = window.WebSocket;
const messages = [];
window.WebSocket = function (...args) {
  const ws = new originalWS(...args);
  ws.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
    messages.push({ time: Date.now(), data: e.data.substring(0, 500) });
  });
  return ws;
};
window.__WS_MESSAGES__ = messages;
```

## Desktop App Optimization (Native Apps)

**macOS:**

- AppleScript / JXA for automation: `osascript -e 'tell app "Notes" to get every note'`
- Accessibility API via computer-use tools for reading UI state
- Many native apps have CLI interfaces (e.g., `defaults read`, `sqlite3` on app databases)
- App databases often stored in `~/Library/Application Support/` — read them directly with SQLite
  **General:**
- Clipboard as a data bus: select all → copy → read clipboard → process
- Screenshot + OCR for apps with no programmatic access
- Computer-use batch operations for repetitive clicking (still faster than one-by-one with delays)

## Platform-Specific Tricks

### CRMs

- Almost all have REST APIs with session cookie auth
- Contact lists are paginated — set limit to max (100-1000)
- Activity/history endpoints exist per-contact for bulk detail fetching

### Project Management Tools

- GraphQL APIs are common — introspect first
- Bulk operations endpoints often exist but aren't in the UI
- Board/list views load all items into DOM — scrape once, no pagination needed

### Email/Communication

- Use email MCP if available — far faster than browser
- Search APIs are powerful — use complex queries instead of manual browsing
- Conversation threading means one API call gets entire threads

### Analytics/Dashboards

- Dashboard data sits in `window.__DATA__` or similar globals
- Look for export/download endpoints
- Embedded iframes have their own API endpoints

### Recruiting/HR (ATS platforms)

- Candidate lists are always API-backed
- Bulk reject/advance endpoints exist
- **Virtual scrolling is common** — check for it immediately and use export/API instead of scrolling

### Social/Content Platforms

- Data often in `window.__INITIAL_DATA__` or similar
- Rate-limited but still 10x faster than manual
- Network tab reveals exact API calls behind every UI action

## Post-Run: Cache What You Learned

After a successful extraction, spend 10 seconds noting what worked:

```
App: pin.com
Method: Export CSV button (top-right nav bar)
Scroll type: Virtual (cards replaced on scroll)
Auth: Session cookies
PII: Emails in export, blocked by JS output filter
Notes: 263 candidates, export got all of them in one click
```

## Leave breadcrumbs so next time takes zero recon. Check for existing notes before starting recon on any app you've seen before.

## Anti-Patterns (Things to Never Do)

- **Never** click through a list of 10+ items manually
- **Never** copy-paste data from a browser one field at a time
- **Never** navigate to each detail page when the list API returns the same data
- **Never** accept "I can't get the data" without trying at least 5 different approaches
- **Never** retry a blocked JS output the same way — switch technique immediately
- **Never** assume an app doesn't have an API — every modern web app does
- **Never** process data inside the browser when you could extract it and use Python
- **Never** make sequential requests when you could parallelize with `Promise.all()`
- **Never** re-discover something you already found — cache API patterns, auth tokens, endpoints
- **Never** forget the MCP check — it's embarrassing to spend 10 minutes browser-hacking an app you have direct API access to
- **Never** start network monitoring AFTER navigating — you'll miss the most important API calls
- **Never** start scrolling without checking scroll type first — virtual scrolling wastes all your work
- **Never** try JS output when you know you need emails/phones — go straight to file download or clipboard

## The Speed Commandments

1. **2 minutes of recon saves 30 minutes of execution.** Always recon first.
2. **Monitor network BEFORE navigating.** The page-load API calls are the ones you want.
3. **Check for export buttons early.** One click beats 100 API calls.
4. **Know your scroll type before scrolling.** Virtual scrolling destroys your work.
5. **Plan for PII filters upfront.** If you need emails, use file download from the start.
6. **The browser is for extraction, not processing.** Get data out fast, analyze in Python.
7. **One bulk API call beats 100 individual page loads.** Always look for the bulk endpoint.
8. **If the Chrome extension blocks your output, you have 6 workarounds.** Use them.
9. **Parallel beats sequential.** Use `Promise.all()` in JS, subagents for cross-referencing.
10. **Every web app has an API.** If you can't find it, you haven't looked hard enough.
11. **Don't just read — discover writes too.** Map mutation endpoints during recon for bulk updates later.
12. **Cache what worked.** Leave breadcrumbs so next time takes zero recon.
13. **Manual clicking is a failure state.** If you're clicking, stop and rethink.
    The goal is always: **minimize human-speed interactions, maximize machine-speed data processing.**
